      "The night before you want to make Pizza, mix the ingredients thoroughly. It helps to begin with the sourdough start, olive oil, salt, and 50-100g of baking flour. This creates an even consistency with the rest of the dough when the rest of the flour and water are added, which prevents clumping. Leave the dough out, lightly covered to allow the yeast to breath, overnight.",
      "The next morning, do 6 stretch-and-folds, then place the lightly covered bowl in the fridge. Take the bowl out an hour or two before you want to use it, to let it come up to room temperature.",
      "Preheat the oven and your pan to the maximum temperature (for example 550 Fahrenheit). If you have the option, set your oven to convection bake. The goal is to make the effective temperature in your oven as hot as possible. Split the dough in half, and roll out each half into the shaped pizza crust you want on a floured surface. Freshly oil your pan, and place your dough on it. Decorate the dough, then place the pizza in the oven for 5-10 minutes (depending on your oven temperature). Take the pizza out when the crust is golden-brown (or to taste)."
